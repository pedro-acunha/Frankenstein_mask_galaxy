# Frankenstein_mask_galaxy
Alpha version of a Python code to apply masks to galaxy images.
The code uses SEP, a Python library for Source Extraction and Photometry, and skimage, a image processing package.

In ./test_mask_images, you can find the data used for testing and the final images after a mask is applied.
